# LC2642DesignGraphWithShortestPathCalculator

## Hint

1. Hint 1 :

   After adding each edge, update your graph with the new edge, and you can calculate the shortest path in your graph
   each time the shortestPath method is called.

2. Hint 2 :

   Use dijkstraâ€™s algorithm to calculate the shortest paths.

## Solution

1. Solution 1
